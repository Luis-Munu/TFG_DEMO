# TFG_DEMO
Streamlit demo for my colleages

TODO:
 - Add some useful metrics to the zone finder.
 - Add a button to check the zone a house is in, and a way to come back to the house.
 - Try again to add background to the central column but it's surely a waste of time.
 - Try again to align the contents of the aggrid table.
 - Try again to remove that black bar above the aggrid table.
 - Find bugs and fix them.
